Description of Project:
The website is for a fashion store called Coqui Fashions.
Coqui Fashions sells mens' apparel and mens' shoes. 

Details on how to use/functionality:
The site contains a home page. The home page has links to the "Apparel" page and the "shoes" page. 
Each page has a link to the "homepage", "Apparel Page" or "Shoes Page". At the bottom nav bar of each page there is a link titled "Get on the List". When you click on the link it takes you to the "Contacts Form" page. The form has 3 required and two optional fields. When you click on the submit button the form is submitted to formspree for processing.
I did not get to do the bootstrap carousel as I was running behind to due unexpected priority projects at my job. I can easily do it if given a bit more time. At this point I need to also catch up on my reading.

Technologies Used:
.html, .css

Ideas for future improvements:
1. Add bootstrap Carousel.
2. Add Accesories page.
3. Add animation.
4. Add About Us and Locations links.
