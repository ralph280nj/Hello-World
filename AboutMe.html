            I <em>love</em> to play basketball in my spare time as often as possible. It is a great form of exercise and stress reliever. 
            I mostly prefer to watch baseball and football than to play.

         <p>I find coding and exercising is a great way for me to relax and take my mind off everyday situations. 
            Reading I mostly do while on a commute or before bedtime.
